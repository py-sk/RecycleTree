RecycleTree is a project from CZ2006 Software Engineering in Nanyang Technological University. It aims to enable users to have a more informed recycling experience, from finding the nearest recycling bins, to checking whether the item they wish to recycle can indeed be recycled, to learning more about recycling and contamination in general. 

RecycleTree has three main components: 
* RecycleGoWhere - Finding the nearest recycling bins to the user's location based on data provided by data.gov.sg
* RecycleCanMeh - Checking if the item to be recycled can indeed be recycled based on image classification models
* RecycleHowAh - Learning more about recycling and contamination of recyclables
